How to build:
Run make in the folder.

Implementation:

Part 1)
I have made use of libpcap library to write the code of dns inject. It takes an 
input file in the form of 2 columns content in which the first column is the ip 
address to which the given domain has to be directed. Please see the test.conf 
sample file.

The inject logic works only for dns A request as per requirement of the 
assignment. Other type of requests are ignored.

How to run:
use sudo to run it. The tool supports following flags:
sudo ./dnsinject [-i interface] [-f file] expression

-i  Listen on network device <interface> (e.g., eth0). If not specified,
	dnsinject should select a default interface to listen on.

-f  Read the ip addresses and domains to be spoofed. If not specified, all dns 
	queries would be spoofed towards the attacker's ip address

expression : a bpf filter to deal with only a specific set of traffic. 
	Optional parameter.

Part 2)
I have made use of libpcap library to write the code of dns detect. It looks 
for dns responses and if there has been multiple responses for one dns 
transaction id, it indicates that the spoofing attempt has been main and 
displayes all the ip addresses in the spoofed dns response packets.

The detect logic works only for dns A request as per requirement of the 
assignment. Other type of requests are ignored. The program is also capable to 
analyze a pcap dump file for spoofed dns responses

How to run:
use sudo to run it. The tool supports following flags:
sudo ./dnsdetect [-i interface] [-r pcacp dump file] expression

-i  Listen on network device <interface> (e.g., eth0). If not specified,
	dnsinject should select a default interface to listen on.

-r  A pcap dump file that you would like to analyze.

expression : a bpf filter to deal with only a specific set of traffic.
	Optional parameter.
